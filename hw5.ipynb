    "**This problem is repeated from HW3 to provide the opportunity for you to revise your project system to address any issues that arise when you try to solve the problems below.  If you do not wish to make any changes, simply include a statement to that effect in your submission for this HW.**\n",

    "c. What are the outputs from the system?  Explain the outputs in physical terms, i.e. what physical device or mechanism measures the output.  ($\\ge 2$ outputs; create one if needed)\n",
